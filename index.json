The total number of articles on the topic of coronaviruses exceeds 40,000 units. Such a volume of scientific production makes it impossible for doctors and researchers to keep up with the latest discoveries without the support of adequate digital platforms that are currently nowhere in sight.\nTo make up for this shortcoming, we propose an artificial intelligence system associated with a web application to perform natural language semantic querying inside the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset published by the American nonprofit AllenAI. The system leverages state-of-the-art neural language models trained on scientific publications in the biomedical domain for optimal retrieval performances. The adoption of the system aims to facilitate knowledge sharing across the scientific community and to accelerate the development of adequate drugs and vaccines to counter the ongoing pandemic.\nThe project is led by Gabriele Sarti in collaboration with Area Science Park and the Italian Association of Computational Linguistics. The project is currently being tested and publicly available at covidbrowser.areasciencepark.it.\n","date":1586563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586563200,"objectID":"af817b3031f8d4070d0147dac0c93688","permalink":"https://gsarti.com/project/covid-browser/","publishdate":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/covid-browser/","section":"project","summary":"A semantic browser for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 powered by neural language models.","tags":["Natural Language Processing","Deep Learning","Information Extraction","Kaggle Competition","AREA Science Park","Italian Association for Computational Linguistics"],"title":"Covid-19 Semantic Browser","type":"project"},{"authors":["Gabriele Sarti"],"categories":["Natural Language Processing","Academic"],"content":"","date":1574380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574380800,"objectID":"01e69dceb562087e59061477e0d6505e","permalink":"https://gsarti.com/talk/neural-lm/","publishdate":"2019-10-27T17:59:41+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/neural-lm/","section":"talk","summary":"An overview of the latest advances in the field of NLP, with a focus on neural models and language understanding.","tags":["Natural Language Processing","Natural Language Understanding","Language Modeling","Deep Learning","StaTalk","University of Trieste"],"title":"Neural Language Models: the New Frontier of Natural Language Understanding","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Gabriele Sarti","Felice Dell'Orletta","Cristina Fenu"],"categories":["Digital Humanities","Divulgative"],"content":"","date":1572519641,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572519641,"objectID":"3519e5984477ceede5ff698b8a0d638c","permalink":"https://gsarti.com/talk/literary-ordnance/","publishdate":"2019-10-27T17:59:41+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/literary-ordnance/","section":"talk","summary":"Discussing the applications of AI and NLP in the fields of literature and digital humanities.","tags":["Natural Language Processing","Digital Humanities","Natural Language Generation","Science+Fiction Festival"],"title":"The Literary Ordnance: When the Writer is an AI","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Gabriele Sarti","Cristina Fenu","Eric Medvet"],"categories":["Digital Humanities"],"content":"We developed an interactive experience putting together NLP and literature to raise awareness on the latest developments in language modeling and natural language generation.
