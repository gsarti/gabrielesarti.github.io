      <title>AItalo Svevo: Letters from an Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We developed an interactive experience putting together NLP and literature to raise awareness on the latest developments in language modeling and natural language generation. Participants received a printed letter written by a neural language model (GPT-2) fine-tuned on the Italian epistolary corpus of Italo Svevo, an italian writer of the 20th century. Participants could choose among several topics discussed by the author in his letters, and were also given some context on author&amp;rsquo;s life and literary production by Cristina Fenu, a digital humanist working at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.museosveviano.it/ar/progetto/archivio-digitale/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Svevian Museum of Trieste&lt;/a&gt;. An open-source implementation will soon be available on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Histopathologic Cancer Detection with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As our final project for the course of Statistical Machine Learning held by Prof. Luca Bortolussi we explored different statistical and deep approaches to the problem of detecting tumors in histopathologic scans. We notably tried a random forest on distributional features extracted by pigment segmentation, a state-of-the-art DenseNet and a Capsule Network with Dynamic Routing.&lt;/p&gt;
